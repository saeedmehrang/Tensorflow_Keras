# Tensorflow_Keras
This is a repository for collection of Deep Learning codes primarily prepared by Tensorflow team but modified and sometimes improved by me. Feel free to use! 

Since the code can be run by Google Colab, there is no need to install any package or dependecy on the local machine. Just follow the instructions in every notebook from the beginning till the end!
